# Overview
ArcGIS Runtime SDK 100.11 for Qt sample applications.  The repo contains [Qt](http://qt.io) projects for each sample that can be run from within the Qt Creator IDE.

# Prerequisites
* Qt SDK 5.15.1 or higher (Open source or commercial)
* Qt Creator
* [ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit - Qt](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt) is required as some samples utilize toolkit components. 
* For more information, please visit the [System Requirements](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/reference/system-requirements/) page.

## Fork the repo
If you haven't already, fork [the repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt/fork).

## Clone the repo

### Command line Git
[Clone the ArcGIS Qt SDK Samples](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo#Step-2-clone-your-fork)

Open your terminal, navigate to your working directory, use ```git clone``` to get a copy of the repo.

```
# Clone your fork of the repository into the current directory in terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git
```

#### Clone the toolkit repo

Change directory into your locally cloned samples repo and then use `git clone` to get a copy of the [ArcGIS Runtime Toolkit - Qt](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt.git).

```
# Change directory to the clone of the samples repository
# Clone the toolkit repository into the current directory in terminal
$ cd /arcgis-runtime-samples-qt
$ git clone https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-toolkit-qt.git
```

Cloning the toolkit in this location will allow for the samples to automatically pick it up. If you wish to place the toolkit in another location, you will need to update the samples project file accordingly to locate the necessary .pri file.

## Configure remote upstream for your fork
To sync changes you make in a fork with this repository, you must configure a remote that points to the upstream repository in Git.

- Open a terminal (Mac users) or command prompt (Windows & Linux users)
- List the current configured remote repository for your fork

```
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git (push)
```

- Specify a new remote upstream repository

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git
```

- Verify the new upstream repository

```
$ git remote -v

origin	https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git (push)
upstream https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git (fetch)
upstream https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt.git (push)
```

### Sync your fork
Once you have set up a remote upstream you can keep your fork up to date with our samples repository by syncing your fork.

- Open a terminal (Mac users) or command prompt (Windows & Linux users)
- Change to the current working directory of your local repository
- Fetch the branches and commits from the upstream repository.  Commits to ```master``` will be stored in a local branch, ```upstream/master```.

```
$ git fetch upstream
```

- Check out your forks local ```master``` branch

```
$ git checkout master
```

- Merge changes from ```upstream/master``` into  your local ```master``` branch which syncs your forks ```master``` branch with our samples repository.

```
$ git merge upstream/master
```
## Open a sample project file in Qt Creator
Start Qt Creator. When the IDE opens to the Welcome screen, click on the **Open Project** button and browse to a project file (.pro) within your forked repo location.
Configure the project and run the sample.

## Use a previous version
The `master` branch contains samples for the current, most up-to-date version of ArcGIS Runtime. To access previous versions, you can checkout by a tag or commit, or alternativley you can download the source zip:

- [100.0](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt/releases/tag/1529)
- [100.1](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt/releases/tag/1744)
- [100.2.1](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt/releases/tag/100.2.1)
- [100.3](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt/releases/tag/2102)
- [100.4](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-runtime-samples-qt/releases/tag/100.4.0.2207)

## Use offline data in the samples
Some of the samples consume offline data, including TPKs, VTPKs, mobile geodatabases, and mobile map packages, among other data formats. If the sample does consume offline data, the sample's associated readme.md will note where you can download the data (from ArcGIS Online), and where the data can be placed once downloaded. For example, it may say something like:

Link | Local Location
---------|-------|
|[Los Angeles Vector Tile Package](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d9f8ce6f6ac84b90a665a861d71a5d0a)| `<userhome>`/ArcGIS/Runtime/Data/vtpk/LosAngeles.vtpk |

In this case, you would download the VTPK from the ArcGIS Online Location, and place in specified location. `<userhome>` is used throughout to denote a generic location on the different platforms. The below table specifies where this is on all of the supported platforms:

Platform |  Userhome Location | Example Location
---------|--------------------|------------------|
Windows  | `%userprofile%`    | `C:\Users\Bob\ArcGIS\Runtime\Data` |
Linux    | `~`                | `/users/bob/ArcGIS/Runtime/Data`   |
Mac OS X | `~`                | `/Users/Bob/ArcGIS/Runtime/Data`   |
Android  | `/sdcard`          | `/sdcard/ArcGIS/Runtime/Data`      |
iOS      | `<your app bundle>`| `<appbundle>/ArcGIS/Runtime/Data`  |
